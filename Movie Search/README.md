# ðŸ”¥ React Movie Search App ðŸŽ¬
  Iâ€™ve built a fully functional Movie Search Website using React.js that integrates The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch real-time movie data. The app is designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience without any backend, relying solely on frontend technologies and API consumption.

## ðŸš€ Key Features:
  - **Home Page:** Displays a list of the most popular and trending movies.
  - **In-built Search:** Allows users to search for any movie using keywords, powered by the TMDb API.
  - **Add to Favourites:** Users can mark movies as favourites and view them later.
  - **Favourites Page:** Displays a list of all favourite movies with no page reload, ensuring a smooth user experience using React state and context.
  - **Responsive UI:** Built with React and styled for various screen sizes.
  - This project helped me strengthen my skills in API integration, React hooks, React Context API, and state management in a real-world application.
